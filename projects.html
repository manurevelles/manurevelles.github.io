                    <p>
                        For the first semester of our <a href="https://ucc-ie-public.courseleaf.com/modules/?details&code=CS5009" target="_blank">Multimedia module</a>, we had to create and edit different
                        multimedia elements following some given requirements. Most involved a chosen city which, in my case, was my hometown Granada. 
                        These have been useful in better understanding graphic design and the tools that can be used.

                        In case you haven't noticed it yet (or didn't read the home page), you are actually navigating through my main <b>Web Development</b> project!
                        Yes, that's it. For my first semester of <a href="https://ucc-ie-public.courseleaf.com/modules/?details&code=CS5002" target="_blank">Web Dev</a> I created this website from scratch. I'm very proud of it,
                        as not more than two months before it I barely knew what <i>HTML</i> and <i>CSS</i> stood for.

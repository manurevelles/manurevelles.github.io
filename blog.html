                <h2>It's starting to feel like Christmas</h2>
                <p class="date">Date: 20/12/22</p>
                <p>
                    Been busy the last couple weeks studying, nothing very relevant happening or worth mentioning, although there is
                    some good news...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Good news: there is only one exam left (systems organisation).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Better news: I'm very happy with how the exams are going. We'll wait for the marks but the effort is paying off.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even better news: I'm going back home for Christmas for the first time in 5 years! My flights are for Thursday morning
                    and I won't be back 'til way after New Years Day. All my last Christmases have been working at the hospital, so I'm really
                    excited to be back home for once. Well deserved if you ask me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I post this it will be the last night I spend studying in a while. I'll share a picture I took recently of <em>christmassy</em> UCC,
                    just across from Boole Library where I've spent lots of time lately.

                <h2>The uncanny exhibition at Boole</h2>

                    I don't know if you've been to the UCC Library recently but there is a running exhibition called <b>TeaTime With The Channellers</b> by <i>David Tibet</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's quite an unusual exposition which, as per the UCC website, "presents the study of esotericism and paganism in Ireland". I had to look this up because 
                    I came out of it quite disturbed and unsure of what I had seen. If that was the goal, consider it accomplished.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The exhibition will continue until Sunday 18th December 2022. You can find it at the Q floor of the Boole library, just at the right as you enter.
                    I've seen they run exhibitions at that same space every 3 to 6 months. I wonder what will be there when I come back after Christmas.

                <p class="date">Date: 02/12/12</p>
                <section>
                    <p>
                        Hey! Christmas is coming!
                    </p>
                    <p>It's the perfect occasion to try the typical Spanish <i lang="es">Roscón de Reyes</i>,
                        also called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_cake#Spanish-speaking_countries"
                            target="_blank">King Cake</a> in other countries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Spain people buy them for the special occasion in a cake shop/supermarket. I've never met
                        anyone
                        that has made it at home before apart from my grandma.
                        Since I've worked every Christmas since I came to Ireland, the <i lang="es">roscón</i> is
                        something that I was
                        missing. Last year I decided to give it a try and... I never thought something
                        so apparently laborious could be rather easy and turn out so well! I assure you this <i
                            lang="es">roscón</i> will
                        taste even better than if you got it from
                        a cake shop.
                    </p>
                    <figure><img src="blog/roscon2.jpg" class="gallery-center"
                            alt="A picture of a Roscón that I did last Christmas. It is filled with whipped cream"
                            title="Believe me when I say it tasted SO good" />
                        <figcaption>This is how good it came out last year!</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        The cake itself reminds more of a sweet bread, similar to a
                        brioche, with a very
                        characteristic flavour obtained from the <b>orange blossom water</b>. Originally it was plain
                        without
                        any filling, but nowadays
                        you'll often see it filled with sweet whipped cream (my favourite), chocolate flavoured cream or <i
                        lang="es">crema pastelera</i> (a custard-like cream).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note: <em>In Ireland, orange blossom water can be found in Arabic or Asian food shops ;)</em>
                    </p>

                    <h4>A bit of background...</h4>
                    <p>
                        <img src="blog/figurines.png" alt="Picture of 3 figurines of the wise kings" />
                        In Spain, instead of Santa Claus, the <b>Three Wise Men</b> bring presents to us. And, instead of
                        bringing them on Christmas day,
                        they do so the 6th of January, which happens to be the date of the <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphany_(holiday)" target="_blank">epiphany</a>.
                        Although the country is not as religious as it once was, we follow this tradition very religiously
                        (pun intended).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the 6th, apart from gifts, we get to eat the <i lang="es">roscón</i>. I have the feeling that
                        it being a seasonal cake makes it taste even better...
                        Inside there should always be hidden two surprises: a <b>figurine</b> of a king and a dry <b>bean</b>.
                        Tradition says that whoever finds the figure will be crowned king, while whoever gets the bean
                        will pay for the <i lang="es">roscón</i>.
                    </p>
                    <p>You can get those same figurines <a href="https://www.dimobasuministros.com/figurita-reyes-magos-corona-para-roscon-reyes-100-ud.html">here</a>, but you
                    could always use any other small figurine you have </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>"Here is the <i lang="es">Roscón de Reyes</i>, a great banquet tradition which conceals two
                            surprises for those
                            who are lucky. In it, very well hidden, there is a bean and a figure; whoever is going to
                            cut it
                            must do so without mischief. Whoever finds something a bit hard in their mouth, may have the
                            bean, or they may have the figure. If you have found the bean this dessert you will pay, but
                            if
                            it is the figure, you'll be crowned and King for a day".</p>

                <section>
                    <h3>Preparation</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Sift the flour and salt into a large mixing bowl, and make a well in the middle.</li>
                        <li>In a smaller bowl, dissolve the yeast into the lukewarm milk and water. Once the yeast is completely dissolved, pour the mixture into the well of the flour.</li>
                        <li>Scrape in just enough flour from around the well to create a thick batter, sprinkle some extra flour on top, and cover with a kitchen towel. Leave the bowl in a warm place for around 15 minutes, or until the batter is doughy and sponge-like.</li>
                        <li>Meanwhile, in another medium mixing bowl, use an electric beater to combine the butter and sugar until creamy.</li>
                        <li>Once the dough is appropriately spongy, add the eggs, brandy, orange rind, and a splash of water to it. Mix well, until the dough is elastic and a bit sticky.</li>
                        <li>Add the butter and sugar mixture to the dough and mix until smooth.</li>
                        <li>Shape the dough into a ball and cover in oiled plastic wrap. Keeping it in the large mixing bowl, cover it once more with a kitchen towel and leave in a warm place away from draft. As the dough proves, it will double in size. This can take anywhere between 1 to 2 hours depending on the strength of the yeast culture.</li>
                        <li>While the dough rises, grease a large baking sheet for later use.</li>
                        <li>Once the dough has doubled in size, remove the plastic wrap. Punch down the dough and place it on a lightly floured countertop or cutting board.</li>
                        <li>You need to knead the dough for two or three minutes, and then roll it into a large rectangle; roughly 2 feet by 1/2 a foot.</li>
                        <li>Next, roll the dough inwards from the long edge to create a sausage shape. Bring the ends together to create the iconic donut, and place on the baking sheet. Want to add the bean or a ceramic toy? Do it now by poking it withing the dough.</li>
                        <li>Wrap the dough once more with plastic wrap and leave in a warm place for roughly one hour to again double in size.</li>
                        <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).</li>
                        <li>Once the dough has risen, lightly beat the remaining egg white and brush it across the top. Cover the cake in the assorted dried fruits, pushing gently so they do not fall off of the cake while it is baking.</li>
                        <li>Bake for 30 minutes or until golden. Cool on the rack before serving.</li>

                <h2>The climbing wall at Mardyke Arena</h2>
                <p class="date">Date: 22/11/22</p>
                <p>
                    I started going to the <a href="https://www.mardykearena.com/" target="_blank">Mardyke Arena</a> when the college term started back in September. As you all may know, having an UCC student card
                    gives you full access to their facilities with a few exceptions. If you didn't know that, take advantage of it! It's never a bad time to get 
                    back to an active lifestyle! I had always heard about how packed it was, and how hard it could be to get use of the machines. I must say it 
                    isn't true, it is actually the best gym I've joined in Ireland. Definitely worth it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the activities not included with the student card is their <a href="https://www.mardykearena.com/facilities/climbing-wall/" target="_blank">Climbing Wall</a>.
                    I gave it a try recently with a friend and enjoyed it a lot. I had never tried climbing before but I found it very enjoyable. Shout out too to the amazing 
                    staff that show you how to gear up and even give you an introduction class. And all of this for only €8 (if you don't have a membership it would be €10).

            <h2>Song of the month</h2>
            <p>
                This time there won't be a single song pick. I'm sharing my own playlist that I use when studying. This
                playlist dates back to
                when I was finishing Nursing. Not many songs have been added since, but I still enjoy it as much and it
                eases the studying process.

                Unfortunately, this month I'm quite busy as the end of semester exams are getting closer, assignments
                don't want to stop piling up
                yet and that's most my eyes focus on lately.
            </p>

                We did start watching 1899 at home and it's been good so far. I'll write about it when I finish all the
                episodes, as right now it's hard to recommend it. You might have finished it already as it seems everybody's
                 been watching it.

            <h2>Book of the month</h2>
            <p>
                So, I finished The Final Empire by Brandon Sanderson and I had mixed feelings. Easy to read and enjoyable, but
                 not memorable enough. I'll write about it in the blog soon.
            </p>
            <p>
                This month I've started <i>The Count of Montecristo</i>. A classic I've been delaying for way too long. So far it reads a
                 bit like a latin telenovela my grandma used to watch non-stop. I'm really into it though, better prose than Sanderson 
                 too, which wasn't difficult. Hopefully I have it finished before the new year. Exams go fast!

            <h2>Pic of the month</h2>
            <p>
                This month I'm sharing a picture taken a cold morning of last week. The car recorded a temperature of -5.5&#176;C.
                It seems like even spiders are having a hard time with the cold weather lately.
